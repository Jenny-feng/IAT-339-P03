            <h1>Project Overview:</h1>
            <p>This Microsite development project requires us to select a client, curate, and write content, define a specific group of users with a specific need, structure the content, and complete a full interactive mockup of the microsite. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our group create a site based on the information of BC SPCA(British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), we aim to address the need of people that are looking for dogs to adopt. Our microsite consists of images, detailed information about the available dogs for adoption, and contact forms for further action. Our primary purpose was to create a welcoming atmosphere through design and provide direct, helpful data for our aimed user group through the content structure.

                <h1>Challenges/Solutions</h1>
                <p >The most challenging part of the process is accurately targeting the user group we are looking for and coming up with a style that best suits their needs. We were first thinking about young people since they are most inclined to adopt a pet; however, it is too broad and out of focus. Then,  by linking to our content, we were providing each puppy’s detailed information and notices, which we think were essential for a first-time pet owner. Then the warm and welcoming style and color palette was driven by the “first-time pet owner” user group we defined.
                </p>

                <p>Also, since it was all of our group’s first time doing web development, it is also a task for us to figure out how to use web development tools like Webflow. My teammate and I did quite some research and watch many videos to try to grasp the concept of every function. As a result, we would be able to achieve most of our purposed ideations with some minor issues existing.

                <p class="paragraph">I had quite a fun experience doing this Microsite web development, which I think is a successful group project. The overall presentation looks decent and almost achieved our initial concept, the style is consistent, and the content was straightforward to our user group. What I learned in this project is that finding your precise target audience is important in any of the design cases, it is the core of the design. The user group determines the content, structure, and style of the work. So it is a necessary step to do comprehensive research for the impacted user before starting any of the actual design work.
