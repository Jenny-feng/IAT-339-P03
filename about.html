                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                <p>My name is Jenny, I am a third year student at SFU, School of Interative Art and Technology. I have always been intreseted in discovering aesthetics in everyday lives. I am passionate about <strong> graphic design, motion graphic, storytelling </strong>and using visual languages to communicate with the world! </p>
                <p>I believe that good design is not only artistically appealing, but also effective in communicating ideas and emotions. That's why I work closely with clients and team members to ensure that my designs meet the needs and objectives of each project. I welcome feedback and strive to incorporate it into my work to create designs that are both visually stunning and effective.</p>
                <p>I looking for graphic/motion design, animation and film intern opportunities, I am capable of using differnet kinds of design softwares  and I am willing to learn the ones that I don't. I do have some experienes working collaboratively with my classmats in film production, animation and web design & development, you can find them under the projects section, Hope we can work together soon :) </p>
