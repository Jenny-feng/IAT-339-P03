            <h1>Project Overview:</h1>
            <p>This is a 3D animation project created for the course IAT 343 Animation. It is a multi-week process to create the animated short movie, so our team was able to research and explore each stage of the animation in depth. The main objective of the project is to utilize all the skills we learned throughout the course to create a well-structured and stylized narrative animated short movie.
            </p>

            <p>
            Our work “Rabi and Pora” tells an emotional story between two friends. Rabbit “Rabi” build the snowman “Pora” to play together. At night, the fireplace was on fire while Rabi was asleep, Pora bravely saved Rabi from the fire and in the end, sacrificed himself.

                    <p>At the Animatic stage, we complete most of our 3D animation in Autodesk Maya, we compiled all the rough clips and created this initial version. The modelling and animation work are looking properly at this stage. We are woring towards building all the necessary effects in post production and create a smoother cut. </p>

                <h1>Challenges/Solutions</h1>
                <p >The biggest challenge of the project occurred during the animation and final editing stages. When we were first doing the animation, the movement of the characters seems to be rigid and unnatural, so we decided to apply more principles of animation to make them look more convincing. For example, we animated a proper walk cycle for Rabi and a Squad and stretch effect to Pora to emphasize each of their form and characteristics. Another difficulty that I found is during our final stage, I realized that all of our parts always have some kind of mismatch, so our final deliverable looks a bit choppy and disconnected. This is because each member of our team is responsible for ⅕ part of the story,  everyone’s style might be different to each other, and that’s why the animation is not smooth enough. But unfortunately, we did not have much time to fix this issue, next time, we would really consider how to properly divide the work so that everyone is on the same page and the final product stays consistent.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">Overall, I think the final animation is a fine work. However, it still has much room for improvement to achieve a better look. For example, the texture of every individual object can be more detailed, and the movement of the character can be smoothed by applying principles of animation and the laws of natural movement.  In conclusion, by completing this animation, I acquired extensive skills in Maya operation including modeling, texturing, animating, and rendering; I also consolidated my skill of post-production in the video editing process. It was a fun journey completing my first animated shorts ever!
